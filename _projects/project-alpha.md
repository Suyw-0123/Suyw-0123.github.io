### [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Suyw-0123/Suyw-0123.github.io)

## Project Overview
This is my first project introduction on this website, and that project is the current GitHub Pages itself.

You can deploy a static website on GitHub Pages without renting a domain—it's completely free. It's perfect for showcasing your portfolio; you can focus solely on creating your static website.

### Features
- Responsive Design
- Dark Mode by default
- Fast loading times

### Technical Stack
The tech stack I used for this webpage is the popular Tailwind CSS and Jekyll for static page generation.

### Other
I'll be putting descriptions of some of my previous projects in the Projects section, and I might also post my development logs in the Dev log section.

The dev log won't just contain my development notes; it might also record useful tools I discover, interesting things that happen during development, and more.
